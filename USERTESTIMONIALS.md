### A conversation with xymoy about the chaotic nature of the enchantments found on weapons!

- xynoy
  - Mate
  - Why does the imperial captain and the imperial soldier at the start of the game just constantly regen to their original health?
  - I **Cannot** defeat them
- me (Luca\|EzioTheDeadPoet)
  - they are most certainly Essential flagged NPCs. Just hit them till they are down and run. Or they have a weapon with an enchantment that heals them.
- xynoy
  - I managed to kill them, they both managed to have the "heal allies in a 10 metre radius enchantments" fighting them in a tight space didn't help lol.
  - thanks for the help
- DoctorStout
  - Lol what a combo!
- me (Luca\|EzioTheDeadPoet)
  - now you need some followers to make use of it as well 😁
- xynoy
  - Very good idea ^^

### Fantastigasmical Alice 🌈's verdict!

I played 15 minutes and now have epic armor that summons a ghost to fight alongside me in battle. 10/10, would power trip through the walk up to Bleak Falls Barrow again :3
