# Tales from Skyrim's Holds

## 1. Introduction

This is a visual overhaul of Skyrim that tries to mimic the look of the "Tales of/from ..." Series, "The Wolf Among Us" and mainly "Borderlands" with their cell shaded visuals.

For the gameplay this list contains mods that will make you stonger and feel like and actual special person in Skyrim just like the Vault Hunters and basically the Dragonborn should be allowed to feel.
