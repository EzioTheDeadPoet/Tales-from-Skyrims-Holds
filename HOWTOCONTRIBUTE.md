[[Back to README]](/README.md)

There are many ways that you can contribute to this modlist. Pick one of the parts below that you want to contribute to:

- [Contributing](#contributing)
  - [Modlist](#modlist)
    - [Issues](#issues)
  - [Screenshots](#screenshots)
    - [Example without a linked profile or website](#example-without-a-linked-profile-or-website)
    - [Example with a linked profile or website](#example-with-a-linked-profile-or-website)

## Modlist

Contributing to the Modlist itself is straight forward. You can have a [Feature Request](#feature-requests), report [Issues](#issues) or maybe you created an awesome character that you want to share.

### Issues

Similar to [Feature Requests](#feature-requests), go to the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/Tales-from-Skyrims-Holds/issues) page and check if your issue was already reported. If you found no similar posts, create a new issue by clicking the green `New issues` button in the top right corner. Select `Bug report` and fill out the document.

## Screenshots

If you want to add your screenshots simply edit the [SCREENSHOTSDISPLAY.md](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/Tales-from-Skyrims-Holds/blob/masterSCREENSHOTSDISPLAY.md) file under the section coresponding to the version of the list you are using, with a pull request here on Github.

Here two examples how to add sceenshots:
