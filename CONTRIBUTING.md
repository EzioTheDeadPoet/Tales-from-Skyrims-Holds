# Contributing

There are many ways that you can contribute to this modlist. Pick one of the parts below that you want to contribute to:

## Modlist

Contributing to the Modlist itself is straight forward. You can have a [Feature Request](#feature-requests), report [Issues](#issues) or maybe you created an awesome character that you want to share.

### Issues

Similar to [Feature Requests](#feature-requests), go to the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/ixanza/xanzas_lotd/issues) page and check if your issue was already reported. If you found no similar posts, create a new issue by clicking the green `New issues` button in the top right corner. Select `Bug report` and fill out the document.
